This is the software and other necessities for the
Predator Protection Device currently in
development.

The directory "for_sd_card" is what should go on
the logging sd card. The directory called "for_audio_sd"
contains the song used during the sound test, and
it can be filled with any mp3 files that you desire.

Note that you will need the following libs:
Adafruit VS1043
NS_Rainbow
RTClib
SdFat
